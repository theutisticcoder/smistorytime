                <div hidden id="tlc-1">
                    <p translate="no">It was too late to turn back now. The crate full of peaches and canned baked beans
                        seemed as heavy as stardust, weighing down the tiny sailboat to a less preferable speed.</p>
                    <p translate="no">&ldquo;France, here I come,&rdquo; Lauren muttered. Keeping her voice down was the
                        best way to survive these days.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Ever since the carbon became too much for Terra, only a select few had survived.
                        Lauren heard a buzz in the distance. <em>Ugh, why now? It must be The Sun Eaters</em>, she
                        thought to herself. The only thing Lauren feared most was those scavengers, hunting every last
                        survivor down and making them convert or become their next meal. Any sudden move, and she was
                        dead meat, and so was the world.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Lauren scrambled toward the control bunker quietly and cautiously, constantly
                        scanning the horizon for the hovercraft. The trash bag was finally found in the middle of the
                        deck, hiding in plain sight again.</p>
                    <p translate="no">The hum of the engine grew louder. And louder. Suddenly, a light could be seen
                        above the clouds, slowly descending upon the sea. Lauren looked at her GPS. Only 20 miles from
                        Maryland, with thousands more to go.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Lauren broke out of daydreaming and ran into her food crate with the bag in her
                        hands. If it came to it, she would sacrifice herself for that bag.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Just as she got in, she could hear the roar of the fog lights waking up. Lauren
                        scanned the dashboard for the control. Finally, she saw it: the smallest button on the entire
                        console, and pressed it.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Nothing happened.</p>
                    <p translate="no">She pressed it again.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Nothing happened.</p>
                    <p translate="no">She tried once more, accepting her fate, but this time the invisibility shield
                        turned on with a loud BLEEP, and before she knew it, the boat was nowhere to be seen from the
                        outside.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Just as the boat was fully covered, Lauren could see the blinding light through
                        the cracks of the crate. She could not see anything outside, only the brightness of the fog
                        lights in the night.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Lauren could feel her heart skip a beat, and it reminded her of something she had
                        ignored while jumping into the crate.</p>
                    <p translate="no">She looked down at her womb, seeing the last trace of her home in her. A boy,
                        kicking her from the inside. The tiny bumps of her soon-to-be son made her heart sing now.</p>
                    <p translate="no">But not for long.. The memories of Dr. Paul came flying back, as if the Sun Eaters
                        were saying, <em>Hey, we&rsquo;re still here!</em> His kindness, his genius mind, and how he
                        <em>had believed </em>in her. Those moments were at peace, now over 2 years ago.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Dr. Paul was probably devoured by the cult that hung him a long time ago, yet
                        Lauren kept his memory close.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Lauren reached into the depths of the camouflage garbage bag, carefully feeling
                        her way around the area. It wasn&rsquo;t long before she felt the titanium shell. Maybe hope
                        wasn&rsquo;t gone. Maybe it was. She didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Time passed, though only a few minutes; it felt like hours. Lauren finally could
                        view the outside ocean, and the hum of the hovercraft was gone. <em>What if they are still here?
                            What if they are trying to lure her out?</em> The thoughts raced through her head.</p>
                    <p translate="no">To be safe, Lauren kept quiet until her digital watch struck midnight. It would be
                        hard to see her boat then anyway, and the hovercraft should be long gone.</p>
                    <p translate="no">She hesitantly turned off the invisibility shield, blowing her cover, and
                        cautiously got out of the boat, scanning her surroundings.</p>
                    <p translate="no">No hovercraft.</p>
                    <p translate="no">No Sun Eaters.</p>
                    <p translate="no">No danger.</p>
                    <p translate="no">A tear rolled down her cheek as she remembered his brutal death. But it was not in
                        vain. When he ran into the town that night, distracting <em>The New Eden (</em>a so-called
                        government of lies, possibly worse than <em>The Sun Eaters</em>) with enough time to hide The
                        Project. The Project was Lauren Kira&rsquo;s work in her lab, and she took it home when chaos
                        unfolded nearby.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Now, ashes, The Project was the only remnant of the lab on the boat, and Lauren
                        would give her life for its success in an instant.</p>
                    <p translate="no">But at this point, any chance of survival and restoration was key, and any chance
                        of getting the old world back would attract deadly predators. These beasts knew nothing but
                        themselves and believed anyone trying to &lsquo;save the world&rsquo; was deemed a threat.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Lauren knew one thing for sure, though, and it was that she had a chance to fix
                        this shit show, and, after all, The Project was not an invention; it was the future&rsquo;s
                        promise. The Promise of humanity&rsquo;s survival. One that could reverse the damages of this
                        planet and its people, and if Lauren knew one thing, it was optimism.</p>
                    <p translate="no"><em>But what if it does not work? Will I still be accepted as a new French
                            citizen?</em> Doubt rushed through Lauren&rsquo;s mind within seconds. But, any chance is
                        better than none, and, working or not, The Project was worth more than her, more than the world
                        her son may lead one day. But with 4 months till due, she had a tight timeline.</p>
                    <p translate="no">Lauren had to focus on the game, a game more threatening than any corrupt
                        &lsquo;government&rsquo;. A game that, on one hand, could have a lot to lose for Lauren. But if
                        one were to win, it may be the only way out of the mess that this world had become.</p>
